## Challenges for interpretation

There are many difficulties involved of the understanding and communication of results from such complex data sets and analyses as we have seen. Let's separate out the different challenges into different levels. The first is the communication within the data scientists, ie communicating methods to practitionners who do not have the same vocabulary or background.

### Interpretation for data scientists reading the methods sections requires a good understanding of the building blocks 

Communicating within the field: what approaches are we talking about?
This requires agreement on a glossary which we have attempted to construct in (ref: Table1).
Then comes a dichotomy of methods and their underlying properties. A simple delineation is available as some methods
aim to predict a clearly defined outcome at the start of the project. This is the case in ref: crossref hackaton example on

Supervised versus unsupervised methods.
Visualization figures are useful for the mathematical and data science team in the Exploratory phase. 

### Interpretation for biologists:
Understanding the output from the analyses of the data is facilitated by the incorporation of contiguous information.
Redundant biological knowledge and incorporation of information from databases are important in the workflow.
Biological interpretations are facilitated by bridges to databases such as KEGG, Gene Ontology, Human Cell Atlas, Biomart and many other databases.
Validation  through complementary data and sequential experimental design.

### Visualization tools for interpretation and communication to biologists
There are pitfalls in using sophisticated graphics which lead to over-interpretation or misinterpretation
(size of clusters in tSNE related to sampling baselines rather than density, ...)
Example of effective visual interpretation tools : brushing UMAP (Kris Sankaran).

### Explaining results to biologists through generative models and simulations (ex: Factor Analysis).
Several difficulties arise when explaining summaries and conclusions, problems encountered include non-identifiability of models
or non-sufficiency of summaries, simulations can often provide effective communication tools.


### Issues of over-discretization, over-simplification
Example 1: The notion of cell-type is insufficient (Communication challenge with biologists about tradeoffs between focusing on rare cell types vs. more “continuous” view on cell types).

Reference the human cell atlas and the cell type discussion (ref:)

Problem with loss of information in the desire to simplify.
