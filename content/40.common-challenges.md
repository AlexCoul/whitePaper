## Commonalities between analytical multi-omics approaches for hackathons

Although the hackathon studies each utilize data from different measurement technologies to highlight disparate challenges to multi-omics, they are unified by the underlying problem of data integration. We summarize the common main challenges faced across all hackathons and the resulting common approaches the participants adopted  to highlight the critical computational challenges for multi-omics single cell data analysis.

**Elana - I think there's room to expand on these two sections. This section is a critical point to the paper and I think could use some more narrative / commentary about the field here in this intro section. In addition to expanding on what's written below, you also say there are common challenges, but then in the third paragraph it says the choice is problem specific. I think there needs to be another paragraph explaining the common challenges and then expanding the two that are here.**

Briefly, table {@tbl:common} summarizes the main methods that were applied across all hackathons. Common main challenges included the assessment of the effect of pre-processing steps (normalization, upstream feature selection), the lack of overlap between cells or features (Figure {@fig:common}), managing differences in scale across data sets, the application of generic approaches developed for bulk data and adapted for single cell data, study specific approaches for spatial analysis (sc spatial and sc proteomics studies) and the inclusion of additional information. A very large number of methods that were applied derive from bulk RNA-seq literature, with the exception of projection methods such as tSNE, UMAP and LIGER (the latter two also based on the common techniques NMF and PCA that were further developed for single cell data).

The choice of methods that were study-specific relied mostly on the challenge or biological question to address. For example, data integration was moslty addressed using projection approaches across all studies, whilst single cell spatial analysis required specific approaches based on Hidden Markov random field or Moran's Index (Figure {@fig:proteomics}B). Still, just as the comptuational methodologies span technologies so to do the central challenges highlighted in each hackathon. Most notably, the accuracy of the analysis depends critically on data pre-processing, variable selection, feature overlap, and imbalances of data size. Each of these challenges must be fully solved to enable subsequent interpretation of multi-scale biological systems from multi-omics data.

**Elana - I wonder if it would flow better to first introduce the specific sections for challenges and then have a summary subsection of common analysis approaches with the table that would flow into interpretation. This ends somewhat abruptly as a transition to that next section as written.**

### Dependence on pre-processing method and/or variable selection
Pre-processing steps strongly affect downstream analyses. Our participants thoroughly assessed the effect of normalisation and data transformation (e.g. sc spatial, Figure {@fig:spatial}Letter), preliminary feature selection (mostly on based on highly variable genes) or feature summarization (scNMT-seq study). Comparisons between analyses were facilitated by providing processed input data (ref to software section), but such step was not sufficient to face reproducibility issues between the original published study and the new analyses. For example in the sc spatial study, Coullomb selected 19 genes (*in scRNA-seq? or seqFISH?*) whereas the original paper (incl ref) was based on 47 genes. No consensus was reached regarding what was the best way to process such emerging data, as no ground truth nor established biological results are yet available (ref: section benchmark).


### Approaches for partial overlap of information (cells / features)
Degree of overlap between datasets varied dramatically within each study. Intuitively, one requires at least one type of overlap (whether on the features, or on cells, Figure {@fig:common}) in order to integrate information across modalities. The field has made progress in developing methods to integrate data sets across the same (bulk) samples of single cells, mostly based on dimension reduction techniques. Amongst them, NMF (LIGER), Projection to Latent Structures (sGCCA) were used for the scNMT-seq study. When there was no cell overlap (sc spatial, sc proteomics), prediction methods were used to predict gene, protein or spatial expression values based on nearest neighbors, latent variables or optimal transpor, or to predict cell types (Hsu). The most challenging study was the sc proteomics, which raised the potential issue of no overlap between cells or features - the so called fourth corner that relies on phenotypes (ref sc proteomics section). We anticipate that this scenario will be avoided once technological progress and increase in data sets availability is achieved [@doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-1926-6]. 

**to do: add in table the overlap between cells (i.e. sc NMT-seq)**

<!--
- Overlap in each study
  - seqFish: same features but not cells; scProt: same proteins, not cells but similar patients; scNMT-seq: same cells but not features
  - How it was solved (Table)
- Anchoring information across datasets or studies is needed (Figure)
- Incorporation of existing biological knowledge
  - ‘From discovery to detection’ (Meuleman + debrief), time is ripe to include more knowledge in our data driven approaches
- Challenge: Partial cell overlap (but no features matching) and No overlap were not addressed
-->

### Managing differences in scale and size across datasets
**potentially move this section higher? and amend order in table**

As all studies in our hackathon did not match either cells or features, different types of techniques were used to address the differences in scale or resolution across data sets. For sc spatial and sc proteomics, participants focused on a common set of genes (via feature selection in sc spatial) or proteins. The scNMT-seq study that included overlap between cells raised the issue of differences in data set size (e.g. number of features). Some projection-based methods can be limited in this setting (e.g. MOFA), requiring a similar number of features in each data set, whilst others such as PLS / sGCCA are not limited by such constraint and enabled flexible analysis (Abadi). Difference in data scale may result in one data set contributing to either too much variation or noise during data integration. techniques such as re-scaling (Jenagan), batch effect removal approaches, such as Combat [@doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037] (Singh), or weighting specific data sets (Arora, Abadi) were considered and all offer further improvement in the analyses.
