## Introduction


### Comprehensive characterization of biological systems with multi-omics
 - Single cell community has advanced technologies to enable concurrent processing of biological systems at multiple molecular resolutions
 - The lack of prior knowledge and gold standard benchmark naturally leads to a data-driven approach

### New single cell multi omics initiatives:
 - Human Cell Atlas (HCA): assess variation in normal tissues
 - Brain initiative and Allen Brain
 - Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN): Single-cell, longitudinal, and clinical outcomes atlases of cancer transitions for diverse tumor types.

### What bulk multi-omics (e.g. TCGA, ENCODE) have taught us:
 - Type of omics that can answer a specific biological question
 - The value of open resources for methodological developments
 - New hypotheses

### Using hackathons to illustrate analysis standards and challenges for capturing biological information from multi-omics technologies
 - Brief overview of our three hackathon studies highlighting state of the art challenges (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, cross-study analysis, epigenetic regulation)
 - Challenges include issues with noise and experimental design, Time lag between regulatory levels not addressed and many open questions
remain (e.g methylation / gene expression), Direction of regulation not captured
 - We present our findings from hackathon case studies that helped us obtain benchmarks and define a common language for multi-omics


- **Objectives of this paper**
    - Provide guidelines on tools / data / technologies / methods and needs to model the multi-scale regulatory processes in biological systems for a computational biologist audience


- **Outline and messages**
    - Cellular and molecular regulation is fundamentally multi-scale and captured by distinct data modalities
    - Traditional hypothesis-driven multi-omics/view studies only consider one facet of these technologies, but more can be learned through a holistic approach extending into atlases
    - We present our findings from hackathon case studies that helped us obtain a broader picture and language
