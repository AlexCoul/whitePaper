## Discussion



In the case of consortia, the ability to impose uniform processing and community standards such as those for ENCODE and IHEC will remain important. The Human Cell Atlas [@https://doi.org/10.1101/121202] showed how community driven initiatives have the ability to influence and inspire across larger proportions of the scientific community. Hackathons are also excellent resources for bringing the community together and providing formal benchmarks.  Together with large consortia studies, hackathons have the potential both to inform and require multi-omics data analysis methods.
In regard to what is needed computationally for the future of multi-omics much will be driven by the data itself. While on the one hand the inherently coupling of measurements simplifies certain challenges, on the other hand the layering of an entirely new set of molecular measurement intrinsically increases complexity. Thus, considerations must be made for cross-modal integration and modeling with both matched and unmatched multimodal measurements. In both cases methods for dealing with data quality, data loss by summarization, timing variances both between and within omics layers, and batch effects will be necessary challenges to overcome. Conversely, the ability to infer regulatory relationships between different omics and expand to dynamic models across time and space presence new opportunities.
