## Discussion

The analyses and reference datasets from the Mathematical Frameworks for Integrative Analysis of Emerging Biological Data Workshop demonstrated the power of hackathons to have the potential both to inform and develop new analysis methods to capture the complex, multi-scale nature of biological datasets from high-throughput data modalities. Notably, the hackathon studies of the workshop were designed specifically to span state-of-the-art multi-omics challenges to map the epigenetic, molecular, and cellular interaction across both time and sample populations. While on the one hand coupling single cell measurements can inherently simplfy the challenge of linking disparate biological scales, layering new sets of molecular measurements intrinsically increases complexity of the corresponding analyses to interpret these data. The computational needs hinge on the underlying biological question being asked as well as the data themselves. For example, different considerations must be made for cross-modal integration higlighted in the seqFISH and scNMT-seq challenges than modeling with unmatched measurements in the scProteomics challenge. Regardless, through these hackathons we identified several common analysis themes spanning algorithmic advances, interpretation, benchmarking, and software infrastructure necessary for biological interpretation. Notably, all cases require methods for dealing with data quality, data loss by summarization, timing variances both between and within omics layers, and batch effects will be necessary challenges to overcome. Conversely, the ability to infer regulatory relationships between different omics and expand to dynamic models across time and space present new analysis opportunities.
